    Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines 
    that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also 
    be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such 
    as learning and problem-solving.
    
    Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that focuses on building systems that learn 
    or improve performance based on the data they consume. Deep Learning is a subset of 
    ML that uses neural networks with many layers.
    
    Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 are advanced AI models trained on vast amounts 
    of text data. They can understand, generate, and translate human language with 
    remarkable accuracy.
    
    Vector databases store data as high-dimensional vectors (embeddings) which capture 
    semantic meaning. They enable efficient similarity search for applications like 
    recommendation systems and question answering.
